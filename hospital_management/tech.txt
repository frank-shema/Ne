The **Multi-Hospital Management System** project leverages several key C++ programming concepts to implement its functionality. Below, I’ll outline the concepts used in building the system, as described in the provided code (`HospitalManagement.h`, `HospitalManagement.cpp`, and `main.cpp`), and explain how they were applied. Given the current date and time (08:56 PM CAT on Thursday, May 22, 2025), the implementation aligns with modern C++ practices (C++17 standard).

### C++ Programming Concepts Used

#### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Classes and Objects**:
  - The `Hospital` and `HospitalNetwork` classes encapsulate the data and behavior for managing hospital records and the network of hospitals, respectively.
  - Example: `Hospital` class contains linked lists (`patients_head`, `doctors_head`, `appointments_head`) and methods like `addPatient`, `updateDoctor`, and `deleteAppointment`.
  - **Encapsulation**: Private member variables (e.g., `hospital_id`, `patients_head`) and public methods ensure controlled access to data.
  - **Abstraction**: The `Hospital` class abstracts the complexity of managing linked lists and file operations, providing a simple interface for CRUD operations.

- **Destructors**:
  - The `Hospital` and `HospitalNetwork` classes implement destructors to clean up dynamically allocated memory (linked list nodes and hospital objects), preventing memory leaks.
  - Example: `Hospital::~Hospital()` deletes all nodes in the linked lists.

#### 2. **Data Structures**
- **Linked Lists**:
  - Singly linked lists are used to manage `PatientsLL`, `DoctorsLL`, and `AppointmentsLL` within each hospital.
  - Example: The `Patient` struct has a `next` pointer to form a linked list, and methods like `addPatient` insert new nodes at the head.
  - **Usage**: Linked lists allow dynamic insertion and deletion of records, which is suitable for the CRUD operations required (e.g., `deletePatient` traverses the list to remove a node).

- **Graph (Adjacency List)**:
  - The hospital network is represented as a graph using an adjacency list (`adjList` in `HospitalNetwork`).
  - `adjList` is an `unordered_map<string, vector<pair<string, double>>>`, where each hospital ID maps to a list of connected hospitals and distances.
  - **Usage**: Facilitates bidirectional connections (e.g., `H1 <-> H2: 2 km`) and enables shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

- **Unordered Map**:
  - `unordered_map` is used in `HospitalNetwork` to store hospitals (`hospitals` maps hospital IDs to `Hospital*` objects) and the adjacency list (`adjList`).
  - **Usage**: Provides fast lookups for hospital data and connections (O(1) average time complexity).

#### 3. **Dynamic Memory Management**
- **Pointers and Dynamic Allocation**:
  - Linked list nodes (`Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`) and hospital objects are dynamically allocated using `new`.
  - Example: `Patient* new_patient = new Patient(patient_id, name, dob, gender);`.
  - **Deallocation**: The destructors use `delete` to free memory, ensuring no memory leaks.

- **Memory Ownership**:
  - The `HospitalNetwork` class owns the `Hospital` objects and is responsible for deleting them in its destructor.

#### 4. **Standard Template Library (STL)**
- **Containers**:
  - `vector<pair<string, double>>`: Used in the adjacency list to store connections and distances between hospitals.
  - `unordered_map`: Used for fast lookups of hospitals and graph edges.
  - `priority_queue`: Used in `findShortestPath` to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path.
    - Example: `priority_queue<pair<double, string>, vector<pair<double, string>>, greater<>> pq;` creates a min-heap for selecting the node with the smallest distance.
  - `unordered_set`: Used in `findShortestPath` to track visited nodes.

- **Algorithms**:
  - `remove_if`: Used in `deleteHospital` to remove connections to a deleted hospital from the adjacency list.
    - Example: `neighbors.erase(remove_if(...), neighbors.end());`.
  - `reverse`: Used in `findShortestPath` to reverse the path vector for correct ordering.

- **Iterators**:
  - STL container iterators are used to traverse `vector` and `unordered_map` elements (e.g., in `displayConnections`).

#### 5. **File I/O**
- **Streams**:
  - `ifstream` and `ofstream` are used for reading from and writing to CSV files.
    - Example: `ofstream file(patients_file);` writes patient data to a file.
  - `stringstream` is used to parse CSV lines into tokens.
    - Example: `stringstream ss(line);` in `loadData` to split CSV rows.

- **File Persistence**:
  - Each CRUD operation updates the corresponding CSV file (e.g., `savePatientsToFile` after `addPatient` or `deletePatient`).
  - Enhanced file handling includes comments for potential database integration (e.g., SQLite), indicating where SQL queries could replace file operations.

#### 6. **Graph Algorithms**
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**:
  - Implemented in `findShortestPath` to calculate the shortest path between two hospitals for patient transfers.
  - Uses a priority queue to select the node with the smallest distance, and maintains a `distances` map and `previous` map to reconstruct the path.
  - Example: The algorithm computes the shortest path from `H1` to `H2`, returning both the path (as a vector of hospital IDs) and the total distance.

#### 7. **Input/Output and User Interaction**
- **Console I/O**:
  - `cin` and `cout` are used for user interaction in the menu-driven interface.
  - **Input Validation**: Helper functions like `getIntInput` and `getDoubleInput` handle invalid inputs using `try-catch` and loops to ensure valid numbers.

- **String Handling**:
  - `getline` is used to read entire lines for string inputs (e.g., names, dates), avoiding issues with spaces.
  - `stringstream` parses input strings into integers or doubles.

#### 8. **Error Handling**
- **Validation Checks**:
  - Methods like `patientExists`, `doctorExists`, and `appointmentExists` ensure ID uniqueness.
  - Appointment validation ensures `patient_id` and `doctor_id` exist before creating an appointment.
  - Example: `if (!patientExists(patient_id))` in `addAppointment`.

- **Exception Handling**:
  - `try-catch` blocks in `getIntInput` and `getDoubleInput` handle invalid numeric inputs.
  - File operations check if streams are open (e.g., `if (file.is_open())`).

#### 9. **Templates and Generic Programming**
- **STL Containers**:
  - The use of `vector`, `unordered_map`, and `priority_queue` leverages C++ templates for generic data storage.
  - Example: `priority_queue<pair<double, string>, vector<pair<double, string>>, greater<>>` uses a custom comparator (`greater<>`) for a min-heap.

- **Pair**:
  - `pair<string, double>` is used to store hospital connections (ID and distance) in the adjacency list.
  - `pair<vector<string>, double>` is returned by `findShortestPath` to provide both the path and total distance.

#### 10. **C++17 Features**
- **Structured Bindings**:
  - Used in `main.cpp` to unpack the result of `findShortestPath`.
    - Example: `auto [path, distance] = network.findShortestPath(start_id, end_id);`.

- **Standard Library Enhancements**:
  - `numeric_limits<double>::infinity()` is used in Dijkstra’s algorithm to initialize distances to infinity.

#### 11. **Functional Programming**
- **Lambda Expressions**:
  - Used in `remove_if` to filter connections in `deleteHospital`.
    - Example: `remove_if(neighbors.begin(), neighbors.end(), [&hospital_id](const auto& n) { return n.first == hospital_id; })`.

#### 12. **Modularity and Code Organization**
- **Header and Source Files**:
  - The project is split into `HospitalManagement.h` (declarations), `HospitalManagement.cpp` (implementations), and `main.cpp` (entry point), promoting modularity.
  - **Forward Declarations**: Structs like `Patient` are defined before their use in the `Hospital` class.

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - `Hospital` handles internal record management, while `HospitalNetwork` manages the graph and network-level operations.
  - Helper functions in `main.cpp` (`getStringInput`, `getIntInput`) separate input handling from business logic.

#### 13. **Const Correctness**
- **Const Member Functions**:
  - Methods that don’t modify the object’s state are marked `const` (e.g., `displayPatients`, `patientExists`).
  - **Usage**: Ensures data integrity and allows these methods to be called on const objects.

#### 14. **Pass-by-Reference**
- **Efficiency**:
  - Strings and other large objects are passed by `const reference` to avoid copying.
    - Example: `bool addPatient(int patient_id, const string& name, const string& dob, const string& gender)`.

#### 15. **Namespace Usage**
- **Using Directives**:
  - `using namespace std;` is used for convenience (though in larger projects, explicit `std::` is preferred to avoid namespace pollution).

### How These Concepts Were Applied

- **OOP and Encapsulation**:
  - The `Hospital` class encapsulates linked lists and file operations, providing a clean interface for managing records. For example, `addPatient` handles both list insertion and file updates internally.

- **Data Structures**:
  - Linked lists allow dynamic management of patients, doctors, and appointments, supporting the CRUD operations required (e.g., `updatePatient` modifies a node, `deleteDoctor` removes a node).
  - The graph (adjacency list) enables the hospital network functionality, such as connecting hospitals (`addConnection`) and finding the shortest path (`findShortestPath`).

- **Dynamic Memory Management**:
  - Dynamic allocation is critical for linked lists and hospital objects, with careful deallocation in destructors to prevent memory leaks.

- **STL and Algorithms**:
  - STL containers like `unordered_map` and `vector` provide efficient storage and lookup for the graph and hospital data.
  - Dijkstra’s algorithm leverages `priority_queue` for efficient shortest path computation, crucial for patient transfers.

- **File I/O and Persistence**:
  - File I/O ensures data persistence, with enhanced handling through structured CSV parsing and comments for future database integration (e.g., SQLite).

- **User Interaction**:
  - The menu-driven interface uses console I/O with robust input validation to ensure a smooth user experience.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Validation checks (e.g., ID uniqueness, appointment validity) and exception handling (e.g., for input parsing) make the system robust.
